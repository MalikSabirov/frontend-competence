# Bundlers

Bundling is the process of combining multiple files, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, fonts, and other assets, into a smaller number of files that are easier to load and manage. A bundler is a tool that automates this process, using various plugins and configurations to transform, compress, and optimize your code and assets. Some of the most popular bundlers are Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, and Browserify.

## <a name="why"></a> Why bundle your code and assets?

Bundling your code and assets is advantageous to your web development workflow and performance. This process reduces the number of HTTP requests and file sizes, improving the loading speed and user experience of your web pages. Moreover, it allows you to use modern features, such as ES6 modules, TypeScript, JSX, SCSS, and PostCSS, which can be transpiled into compatible and minified code for older browsers. Additionally, bundling enables you to split your code into smaller chunks and load them on demand, enhancing the scalability and maintainability of your web applications. Furthermore, it simplifies the management of dependencies and versions while automating tasks like linting, testing, and debugging. In short, bundling saves you time and effort while ensuring that your code and assets are consistent and up to date.

## <a name="howWorks"></a> How does bundling work?

Bundling works by analyzing your entry point file, which is usually an HTML or a JavaScript file that references other files, and creating a dependency graph that shows how your code and assets are related. Then, it applies various transformations, such as transpiling, minifying, hashing, and inlining, to each file in the graph, and outputs a bundle or multiple bundles that contain the optimized code and assets. Depending on the bundler you use, you can customize the output format, the naming convention, the directory structure, and the plugins you want to use.

## How to choose a bundler?

When selecting a bundler, you should take into account your project requirements, preferences, and experience. Every bundler has its own advantages and disadvantages; however, there are some general factors to consider. The size and complexity of your project can influence which bundler you choose. For instance, larger and more complex projects may need more powerful and flexible bundlers such as Webpack, while smaller and simpler projects may prefer more lightweight and easy-to-use bundlers like Parcel. Additionally, you should look at the features and plugins available with different bundlers. Different bundlers support different features and plugins, such as hot module replacement, code splitting, tree shaking, and source maps. Lastly, you should consider the documentation quality and community support of each bundler. You should choose a bundler that has clear and comprehensive documentation, as well as active and helpful community forums and resources.

## How to use a bundler?

Using a bundler usually involves three steps: installing, configuring, and running. Depending on the bundler you choose, the exact steps may vary. Generally, you need to install the bundler and its dependencies, such as Node.js and npm, on your local machine. You can do this with the command line or a package manager like npm or yarn. Then, you must create and edit a configuration file in your project folder, such as webpack.config.js or parcel.config.json. This file contains settings and options that tell the bundler how to process your code and assets, such as the entry point, output path, plugins, and loaders. Finally, you need to run the bundler in your command line or terminal using commands like webpack or parcel. Additionally, you can use scripts like npm scripts or gulp tasks to run the bundler with different modes and options like development or production.
