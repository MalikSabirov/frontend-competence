### Disadvantages

<ol>
  <li>
      <details>
      <summary>Performance Issues</summary>
      <p>
        npm can sometimes suffer from performance issues, especially in large-scale projects with many dependencies. Some developers find Yarn and pnpm faster. Slow installation times and high resource consumption may impact developer productivity and build times.
      </p>
    </details>
  </li>

  <li>
      <details>
      <summary>Versioning Complexity</summary>
      <p>
        Managing package versions and dependency conflicts can be challenging with npm, particularly in projects with complex dependency trees. Resolving version conflicts and ensuring compatibility between packages may require manual intervention and careful oversight.
      </p>
    </details>
  </li>

  <li>
      <details>
      <summary>Dependency Bloat</summary>
      <p>
        npm's default behavior of installing packages locally can lead to dependency bloat, where projects accumulate unnecessary dependencies over time. This can increase project size and complexity, potentially impacting performance and maintenance efforts.
      </p>
    </details>
  </li>

  <li>
      <details>
      <summary>Security Concerns</summary>
      <p>
        npm packages are not immune to security vulnerabilities, and relying on third-party code introduces potential risks to projects. While npm provides tools for auditing packages and detecting vulnerabilities, developers must remain vigilant and proactive in addressing security issues.
      </p>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
      <details>
      <summary>Reliance on Centralized Registry</summary>
      <p>
        npm's reliance on a centralized registry for package distribution and discovery introduces a single point of failure and potential network bottlenecks. Disruptions or outages in the npm registry can disrupt development workflows and dependency management processes.
      </p>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
      <details>
      <summary>Limited Offline Support</summary>
      <p>
        While npm provides some support for offline installations through local caches, its offline capabilities are not as robust as some other package managers like Yarn. Developers working in environments with limited or intermittent internet connectivity may encounter difficulties when relying on npm.
      </p>
    </details>
  </li>
</ol>

Overall, while npm is a powerful and widely adopted package manager, developers should be aware of its limitations and consider alternative solutions or best practices to mitigate potential challenges in dependency management and project maintenance.
